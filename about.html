        I am a student at Loyola University Chicago, where I major in
        Software Engineering with a minor in Psychology. I became interested in
        computer science when I took my first computer science class my senior
        year of high school. I became interested in learning how things work.
        I wanted to know what allows a person to interact with a computer.
        What happens when a person clicks a link? How is a website designed?
        How is data used? What function is created to organize data?
        Where does this all happen? I became intrigued by the language computer
        scientists learn to speak in order to communicate with a computer.

        I have always been interested in psychology because I grew up reading
        books. I would read about book characters and wonder why they are the
        way they are. I became interested in trying to understand what makes a
        person a person and why people are different from each other. Why are
        people so different? How can they be so similar? How do people develop?
        It amazes me how people are always changing. I am always curious to
        understand how, and it always feels like an endless opportunity to learn
        when I try to understand why.

      <p> <!--finish writing-->
        Computer science and psychology are two extremely different subjects,
        but I have always seen them as two parallel areas.
