        Hello, I'm Janeen Soria and this is my personal website I created.
        I wanted to have a website so people can get an idea on who I am, and because
        I think it's a bit fun to make a website for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am finishing up my Software Engineering degree this semester, and I will graduate
        with a Software Engineering degree and a Psychology minor. I'm currently applying for
        jobs and internships, and in the far future I hope to combine computer science and
        psychology.

    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="aboutme">
      <p> <!--TODO update-->
        I am a student at Loyola University Chicago, where I major in
        Software Engineering with a minor in Psychology. I became interested in
        computer science when I took my first computer science class my senior
        year of high school. I became interested in learning how things work.
        I wanted to know what allows a person to interact with a computer.
        What happens when a person clicks a link? How is a website designed?
        How is data used? What function is created to organize data?
        Where does this all happen? I became intrigued by the language computer
        scientists learn to speak in order to communicate with a computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have always been interested in psychology because I grew up reading
        books. I would read about book characters and wonder why they are the
        way they are. I became interested in trying to understand what makes a
        person a person and why people are different from each other. Why are
        people so different? How can they be so similar? How do people develop?
        It amazes me how people are always changing. I am always curious to
        understand how, and it always feels like an endless opportunity to learn
        when I try to understand why.
      </p>
      <p>
        Computer science and psychology are two extremely different subjects,
        but I have always seen them as two parallel areas. Computer science has
        hardware and software, which I think of is equivalent to how people have
        biology and psychology. A program has code that tells it what to do like
        how a person's personality affects how they act. Psychology complements
        computer science, because it's used for user testing, UI, UX, and even
        AI since developers need to know how a person thinks in order to create
        an AI machine. I want to combine computer science and psychology
        because I believe it makes problem-solving more effiecient. In order to
        create optimal code, one must understand people.
